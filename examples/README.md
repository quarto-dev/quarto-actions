## FAQ

* My project uses git lfs storage; how should I adapt the action?

  If your project uses git lfs storage, you must opt-in to git lfs during the `checkout` step.

  ```yaml
        - name: Check out repository
          uses: actions/checkout@v4
          with:
            lfs: true # needed when using lfs for image storage
  ```

  See the [checkout action documentation](https://github.com/actions/checkout) for details.
