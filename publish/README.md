# Publishing with Quarto using GitHub Actions

This README complements the more detailed documentation on [Quarto's website](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/).

## Netlify 

> See also <https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/netlify.html> about Netlify publishing support in Quarto.

1. Create Netlify auth token. Go to Netlify's [applications page](https://app.netlify.com/user/applications), and click on "New Access Token" to create a new personal access token.
Give this token a memorable name, and note the resulting string (or keep this window open in a tab)

2. Add Netlify auth token to your repository's secrets. Go to the repository that will be using this GHA. Click on "Settings". On the new page, click on "Secrets", then on the dropdown "Actions". Now, on the right-hand tab, click on the "New repository secret" button to the right of the title "Actions secrets". For the "Name" field, use `NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN`, and for the "Value" field, paste the string you got from step 1.

3. Add the GitHub Actions workflow to your project. (Use [quarto-publish-example.yml](../examples/quarto-publish-example.yml) as an example).

4. Add `_publish.yml` to your repository. Quarto stores publishing metadata information in `_publish.yml`. To create this file, run `quarto publish netlify` locally once.

5. Configure action to use netlify:
   
   ```yaml
   - name: Publish to Netlify (and render)
     uses: quarto-dev/quarto-actions/publish@v2
     with:
       target: netlify
       NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN }}
   ```

## GitHub Pages

> See also <https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html> about Github Pages publishing support in Quarto.  
> And <https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html#github-action> about using Github Actions to publish to Github Pages with Quarto.

1. Quarto needs to configure the repository for publishing through GitHub Actions. To do this, run `quarto publish gh-pages` locally, once. This will create a new branch called `gh-pages` and push it to the remote repository, and configure the gh-pages branch to be the [publishing source for GitHub Pages](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html#source-branch).

2. Then you need to configure your repo to use Github Actions to publish, by adding GitHub Actions workflow to your project.
   - Use [quarto-publish-example.yml](../examples/quarto-publish-example.yml) as an example
   - Go over our documentation for additional details at <https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html#github-action>

### Details on how to configure the GitHub Actions workflow

When using `quarto-dev/quarto-actions/publish`, configure it to use `gh-pages` as publishing target:

```yaml
- name: Publish to GitHub Pages (and render)
  uses: quarto-dev/quarto-actions/publish@v2
  with:
    target: gh-pages
  env:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # this secret is always available for github actions
```

If you not using [quarto-publish-example.yml](../examples/quarto-publish-example.yml), check the minimum required access for the `publish` action: You need to set `contents` permissions to `write`.

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: write
```

See Github's documentation on `permissions` for more details
- Setting permissions for a workflow: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#permissions
- Setting permissions for a workflow job: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idpermissions

## Posit Connect

> See also <https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/rstudio-connect.html> about Posit Connect publishing support in Quarto.  

1. Create Posit Connect auth token.  After logging in to your Posit Connect server, click on your username on the top right. A sidebar should slide in from the right. Click on "API keys". On the new page, click on the "New API Key" button. Give it a memorable name and note the resulting string (or keep this browser window open).

2. Add Posit Connect auth token to your GitHub repository. Go to the GitHub webpage for the repository that will be using this GitHub Action. Click on "Settings". On the new page, click on "Secrets", then on the dropdown "Actions". Now, on the right-hand tab, click on the "New repository secret" button to the right of the title "Actions secrets". For the "Name" field, use `CONNECT_API_KEY`, and for the "Value" field, paste the string you got from step 1.

3. Add the GitHub Actions workflow to your project. (Use [quarto-publish-example.yml](../examples/quarto-publish-example.yml) as an example).

4. Add `_publish.yml` to your repository. Quarto stores publishing metadata information in `_publish.yml`. To create this file, run `quarto publish connect` locally once.

5. Configure action to use Posit Connect:

   ```yaml
   - name: Publish to Posit Connect (and render)
     uses: quarto-dev/quarto-actions/publish@v2
     with:
       target: connect
       CONNECT_SERVER: enter-your-server-url-here
       CONNECT_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.CONNECT_API_KEY }} 
   ```

## Other configurations available for Quarto Publish action

The `with` parameter can also be set to configure the following

* `path`: Subdirectory containing the quarto project to be published or path to individual .qmd file. Default to working directory (`.`)
* `render`: Set to `render: "false"` to skip rendering of project before publishing. By default, this `publish` action will render to all formats defined.

## Rendering with a Quarto profile

`quarto publish` will render first by default. You can render with a specific profile by setting the `QUARTO_PROFILE` environment variable. For example, to publish the version correspondig with the `preview` profile of your website (i.e. you have a `_quarto-preview.yml` file in your project), you can do:

```yaml
- name: Render Quarto Project
  uses: quarto-dev/quarto-actions/publish@v2
  env:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # this secret is always available for github actions
    QUARTO_PROFILE: preview
  with:
    target: gh-pages
```
